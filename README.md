# Firefox-ONE Theme for Opera One Skin Lovers (But More Minimal)

This is a fork of the [Firefox One](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-one) project. I've edited the new tab page to make it simpler and more minimalistic. If you're into a clean, distraction-free browsing experience, you might like this.

## Changes

- Removed the search box from the new tab page. The address bar is more than enough for all your searching needs.
- Replaced the background with a solid color image. **It's simple, it's clean, it's minimal**.
